# üìä DIP: Data Ingestion Pipeline

**DIP** (Data Ingestion Pipeline) is a modular, scalable system designed to collect, process, and deliver social‚Äëmedia analytics to downstream machine‚Äëlearning services. Although its first use case targets TikTok and Instagram metrics for abaya‚Äëseller content optimization, its architecture is adaptable to any streaming or batch data source.

---

## üîç Overview

DIP automates the end‚Äëto‚Äëend flow:

1. **Data Connectors** fetch raw metrics from APIs.
2. **Data Lake** persists raw, unmodified payloads for audit and replay.
3. **Processing & Feature Store** normalizes, enriches, and stores cleaned data.
4. **Orchestration & Scheduling** ensures reliability, retries, and lineage.
5. **Monitoring & Alerting** tracks health, latency, and data quality.

This workflow guarantees fresh, accurate inputs for any ML or analytics consumer.

## üèó Architecture

The DIP architecture is designed for enterprise-grade throughput, reliability, and maintainability:

```

Key highlights:

* **Ingestion Gateway** handles authentication, backpressure, and integrates with the DLQ for poison messages.
* **Message Broker with DLQ** ensures at-least-once delivery and dead-lettering problematic records automatically.
* **Multi-zone Storage** (Raw ‚ñ∂ Bronze ‚ñ∂ Silver) supports schema evolution, data validation, partition pruning, and encrypted retention policies.
* **Streaming ETL** maintains event-time processing, watermarks, and exactly-once semantics, with side outputs for error handling.
* **Feature Store** separates high-throughput online serving (Redis) from bulk offline retrieval (BigQuery/Snowflake).
* **Orchestration & Governance** automates retries, tracks lineage, and ensures schema compatibility via the registry.
* **Observability** provides end-to-end metrics, traces, and log correlation for rapid incident response.
* **Security** enforces encryption-at-rest/in-transit, centralized secret management, and fine-grained access controls.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Steps

1. **Connect & Authenticate**

   * Initialize connector with credentials from Vault/KMS.
   * Validate connectivity and check API quotas.
2. **Fetch & Stream**

   * Pull paginated data in scheduled jobs or continuous streams.
   * Publish each batch/message to the raw ingest topic in Kafka\_PubSub.
3. **Validate & Persist Raw**

   * Consumer writes raw JSON to object storage, partitioned by source/date.
   * Poison messages routed to a Dead-Letter Queue for manual inspection.
4. **Streaming ETL**

   * Deserialize messages, apply schema validation from the registry.
   * Transform timestamps, compute derived fields (e.g., engagement\_ratio).
   * Emit cleaned records to Bronze Zone and archival sinks.
5. **Batch/Historical Processing**

   * Run nightly Spark jobs for backfills or reprocess historical data.
6. **Feature Engineering**

   * Aggregate time windows (hourly/daily), vectorize text (captions, hashtags).
   * Store feature tables in Feature Store with versioning.
7. **Consume & Serve**

   * ML jobs pull offline features for model training.
   * Real-time API queries online features to score new posts on demand.
8. **Monitoring & Alerting**

   * Track connector latencies, ETL processing times, and data freshness SLAs with Prometheus.
   * Alert on errors, high DLQ rates, or schema mismatches via Grafana/Kibana.
9. **Feedback Loop**

   * Log predictions and real engagement metrics back into the pipeline for retraining.
   * Enable A/B testing workflows by tagging traffic in inference endpoints.

1. **Connect**
   ‚Ä¢ Authenticate and fetch metrics (e.g. post views, likes, comments, audience demographics) via TikTok/Instagram APIs.
2. **Persist**
   ‚Ä¢ Write raw payloads to object storage, partitioned by date and source.
3. **Process**
   ‚Ä¢ Schedule ETL jobs to normalize timestamps, extract hashtags, compute engagement ratios, and handle missing fields.
   ‚Ä¢ Store enriched records in a low‚Äëlatency feature store for consumption.
4. **Serve & Consume**
   ‚Ä¢ Expose feature endpoints via microservice for both batch re‚Äëtraining and real‚Äëtime scoring.
5. **Monitor**
   ‚Ä¢ Track connector success rates, ETL durations, and data freshness.
   ‚Ä¢ Trigger alerts on failures or SLA breaches.

## üìÅ Components

* **Connectors**: Python clients for each social API, with pagination and rate‚Äëlimit handling.
* **Data Lake**: Immutable raw store for audit and replay scenarios.
* **ETL Workers**: Kafka‚Äëdriven or batch Spark jobs transforming raw to structured.
* **Feature Store**: Redis for real‚Äëtime, Apache Hudi for batch serving.
* **Orchestrator**: Airflow or Prefect DAGs managing dependencies and retries.
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards.
* **Microservices**: FastAPI endpoints delivering features to ML and BI layers.

## üìà Adaptability & Scaling

* **Pluggable Connectors**: Add new APIs by implementing a standard interface.
* **Storage Agnostic**: Swap S3 for GCS or HDFS with minimal config.
* **Auto‚ÄëScaling**: Containerized workers scale on message queue depth or batch backlog.
